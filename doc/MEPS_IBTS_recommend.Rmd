## Recommended plotting approach from the MLEbins method

This vignette has some of the calculations used to explain the recommended
plotting approach, reproduces Figures S.4 and Figure 7 and presents
Figures S.5 to S.34 as a movie.

```{r}
library(sizeSpectra)
# library(tibble)  # Else prints all of a tibble
```

## Schematic diagram for two species

Picking two example species (coloured in red in Figure 6). Codes are 127205
(Moustache Sculpin) and 154675 (Snakeblenny).

```{r}
sculpin = 127205
snakeblenny = 154675
specForFig = c(snakeblenny, sculpin)

dataTwoSpec = dplyr::filter(dataBin, SpecCode %in% specForFig)
```

Combine the data across all years for illustrative purposes (to reduce the number
of empty bins in the illustration):
```{r combine}
dataComb = dplyr::summarise(dplyr::group_by(dataTwoSpec,
                                            SpecCode,
                                            wmin),
                            wmax = unique(wmax),
                            number = round(sum(Number), dig=4))
dataComb = dplyr::mutate(dataComb, j = dplyr::min_rank(wmin))   # works since they're grouped
dataComb[nrow(dataComb), "j"] = 25                       # manually, because there's a gap
dataComb = dplyr::mutate(dataComb, wmid = (wmin + wmax)/2)  # midpoint for plotting
```

Now create Figure S.4, with semi-automated text for the caption:
```{r fig.width=6.5, fig.height=4}
target = 7                 # target bin (for species 2)

target.wmin = dplyr::filter(dataComb,
                            SpecCode == specForFig[2],
                            j == target)$wmin

                            SpecCode == specForFig[2],
                            j == target)$wmax

```

Figure S.4 caption: Schematic diagram to explain how we calculate
  the range of counts of individuals that are larger than those in a given bin.
  Red and pink body-mass bins are those for Snakeblenny and Moustache Sculpin
  (labelled species 1 and 2, respectively) from Figure 5 in the paper.
  Bin breaks are denoted by $w_{s,j}$
  and the number inside each bin is the number observed per hour of trawling.
  For illustration the data are combined across all years and only bins with
  minima $>15$ g are shown. The target bin has $s=2$ and $j=7$ and therefore
  has bin breaks $w_{2,7}$ and $w_{2,8}$ and is indicated by the vertical grey
  lines.
  The first letter in each pair (NN, NY or YY) denotes whether or not
  each bin is included in the low count $E_{2,7,1}$, i.e. its lower bound is
  $\geq$ the upper bound of the target bin. Similarly, the second letter denotes
  whether or not each bin is included in the high count $E_{2,7,2}$, i.e.
  its upper bound is $>$ the lower bound of the target bin. Summing the
  respective counts as per (S.30) and (S.31) gives
  $E_{2,7,1} =$ `r f(lowCount,2)` and $E_{2,7,2} =$ `r f(highCount,2)`.

## Results plotted for each year

These calculations are to get the required input for the recommended plot (see
`?sizeSpectra::ISD_bin_plot` for the structure). This could maybe be
functionalised like the plotting function `ISD_bin_plot()`.
```{r recommended}
dataRecommend.isd = dplyr::select(dataBin,
                                  Year,
                                  wmin,
                                  wmax,
                                  Number)


data.year.list = list()                # to save results for each year

fullYears = sort(unique(dataBin$Year))
for(i in 1:length(fullYears))
  {
    data.year = dplyr::filter(dataRecommend.isd,
                              Year == fullYears[i])

    data.year = dplyr::arrange(data.year,
                               desc(wmin))
    sumNumber = sum(data.year$Number)

    # data.year = dplyr::mutate(data.year,
    #                          cumSum = cumsum(Number))
    # This is wrong when we have two species with the same
    #  length-weight coefficients in the same year, so need countGTEwmin below
    # Have to do not with dplyr:
    wmin.vec = data.year$wmin
    wmax.vec = data.year$wmax
    num.vec  = data.year$Number

    countGTEwmin = rep(NA, length(num.vec)) # to do a manual count
    lowCount = countGTEwmin
    highCount = countGTEwmin

    for(iii in 1:length(countGTEwmin))
    {
      countGTEwmin[iii]    = sum( (wmin.vec >= wmin.vec[iii]) * num.vec)
      lowCount[iii]  = sum( (wmin.vec >= wmax.vec[iii]) * num.vec)
      highCount[iii] = sum( (wmax.vec >  wmin.vec[iii]) * num.vec)
    }
    data.year = cbind(data.year,
                      "countGTEwmin" = countGTEwmin,
                      "lowCount" = lowCount,
                      "highCount" = highCount)
    data.year = dplyr::tbl_df(data.year) # This is one of the desired input for
                                         #  the plotting function below

    data.year.list[[i]] = data.year
}

xlim.global = c(min(dataRecommend.isd$wmin),
                max(dataRecommend.isd$wmax))   # x-axis limits to be common for
                                               # all plots
```

Here is the code to give an animation for Figures 7 and S.5-S.34 for the IBTS data. For each year
(given in top-right corner) the plot shows the individual size distribution and
MLEbins fit (red solid curve) with 95\% confidence intervals (red dashed curves, may be hard to see).
For each bin, the horizontal green line shows the range of body sizes, with value on the y-axis
corresponding to the total number of individuals in bins whose minima are $\geq$
the bin's minimum.  For each bin, the vertical span of the grey rectangle shows
the possible range of the number of individuals with body mass $\geq$ the body
mass of individuals in that bin (horizontal span is the same as for the green
lines). The text in (a) gives the year, the MLE for the size-spectrum exponent
$b$, and the sample size $n$.

Here is the code to build the movie, but it is commented out since it causes Travis
to fail -- Travis is the continuous integration service that automatically
checks the packages builds every time a change is committed to GitHub, giving the
little green symbol `passing` icon on the main page. The trick to showing the
movie is to run the code uncommented (you need to install the `gifski` package), right-click on the animation in the
html viewer and save it. I've done that and so am leaving this code commented,
and will just refer to the saved animation file.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
# ```{r, animation.hook = 'gifski', interval = 1.5, fig.width = 5.36, fig.height = 8}
# fig.width is 0.67 * fig.height (which is 8)
#
# for(i in 1:length(fullYears))  # Not tested new options here (from _all vignette)
#    {
#    ISD_bin_plot(data.year = data.year.list[[i]],
#                 b.MLE = dplyr::filter(MLEbins.res, Year == fullYears[i])$b,
#                 b.confMin = dplyr::filter(MLEbins.res, Year ==
#                                                      fullYears[i])$confMin,
#                 b.confMax = dplyr::filter(MLEbins.res, Year ==
#                                                      fullYears[i])$confMax,
#                 year = fullYears[i],
#                 xlim = xlim.global,
#                 xmin = dplyr::filter(MLEbins.res, Year ==
#                                                      fullYears[i])$xmin,
#                 xmax = dplyr::filter(MLEbins.res, Year ==
#                                                   fullYears[i])$xmax,
#                 IBTS_MEPS_figs = TRUE
#                 )
#  }
# ```
```

The resulting animation is

To save each year as it's own figure do this (not it running here; you have to
make the `IBTS-ISD-figs` directory first):
```{r, eval=FALSE}
for(i in 1:length(fullYears))
  {
  postscript(paste0("../IBTS-ISD-figs/IBTS-ISD", fullYears[i], ".eps"),
           height = 8, width = 5.36,
           horizontal=FALSE, paper="special")

  ISD_bin_plot(data.year = data.year.list[[i]],
               b.MLE = dplyr::filter(MLEbins.res, Year == fullYears[i])$b,
               b.confMin = dplyr::filter(MLEbins.res, Year ==
                                                     fullYears[i])$confMin,
               b.confMax = dplyr::filter(MLEbins.res, Year ==
                                                     fullYears[i])$confMax,
               year = fullYears[i],
               xlim = xlim.global,
               xmin = dplyr::filter(MLEbins.res, Year ==
                                                    fullYears[i])$xmin,
               xmax = dplyr::filter(MLEbins.res, Year ==
                                                 fullYears[i])$xmax,
               IBTS_MEPS_figs = TRUE
               )
  dev.off()
}
```

Do this to include (in a LaTeX file) a loop that plots each figure one at a
time, like in our Supporting Information.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
% Include this in latex preamble:
\newcommand\isdfig[2]{    % filename is #1, text is #2
  \begin{figure}[tp]
  \begin{center}
  \epsfbox{IBTS-ISD-figs/IBTS-ISD#1.eps}
  \end{center}
  \vspace{-5mm}
  \caption{#2}
  \label{fig:ISD-#1}
  \end{figure}
  \clearpage
}

% Include this after the figures have already been created in an R loop
\isdfig{\Sexpr{fullYears[1]}}{Include caption as above for year \Sexpr{fullYears[i]}}

\newcounter{loop}

\newcommand{\loopMax}{\Sexpr{max(fullYears)+1}}
\forloop{loop}{\Sexpr{fullYears[2]}}{\value{loop} < \loopMax}
        {\isdfig{\arabic{loop}}{Individual size distribution and MLEbins fit
            with 95\% confidence intervals for IBTS data in \arabic{loop}.
            Details as in Figure~\ref{fig:ISD-1986}.
}}
```
