## Combining the four MEPS\_IBTS\_ vignettes into one to repeat the analyses

Here we combine the essential elements of the four vignettes

* [MEPS_IBTS_1.html](MEPS_IBTS_1.html)

* [MEPS_IBTS_2.html](MEPS_IBTS_2.html)

* [MEPS_IBTS_MLEbins.html](MEPS_IBTS_MLEbins.html)

* [MEPS_IBTS_recommend.html](MEPS_IBTS_recommend.html)

to repeat the analyses with an alternative value for the minimum body size
(100 g, as opposed to the original 4 g), as suggested by a reviewer. This is to see
if the larger fish can be fit well TODO bit more explanation. We retain only the necessary
details of the four vignettes; the four vignettes should be used for initial
understanding, this one is to repeat the analysis with alternate assumptions (or
data). We simplify much of the text here as well, to focus on the code.

## Pre-processing of IBTS data to get desired data for MEPS Table 1

This is simplified from [MEPS_IBTS_1.html](MEPS_IBTS_1.html) -- see that
vignette for full explanations.

```{r setup}
library(sizeSpectra)
```

Use the saved original data set:
```{r}
dim(dataOrig)
names(dataOrig)
```

Keep the desired columns, noting that `data` will change a lot in the following
code and will end up in a standard format:
```{r}
numAreas = length(unique(dataOrig$Area))
colsKeep = c("Year",
             "AphiaID",
             "LngtClas",
             "CPUE_number_per_hour",
             "a",
             "b",
             "weight_g",
             "CPUE_bio_per_hour")
colsDiscard = setdiff(names(dataOrig), colsKeep)

data = sizeSpectra::s_select(dataOrig, colsKeep)   # uses Sebastian Kranz's s_dplyr_funcs.r
```

1. Rename the columns:
```{r rename}
if(sum( colsKeep != c("Year", "AphiaID", "LngtClas", "CPUE_number_per_hour",
    "a", "b", "weight_g", "CPUE_bio_per_hour")) > 0)
       { stop("Need to adjust renaming") }
names(data) = c("Year", "SpecCode", "LngtClass", "Number", "LWa", "LWb",
         "bodyMass", "CPUE_bio_per_hour")
# CPUE_bio_per_hour is Number * bodyMass
```

2. Make cm not mm:
```{r cm}
data$LngtClass = data$LngtClass/10
```

3. Rearrange the order to be more intuitive:
```{r arrange}
data = dplyr::arrange(data, Year, SpecCode, LngtClass)
```

Aggregate multiple counts of the same length fish of the same species in the
same year:
```{r, aggregating}
data = dplyr::summarise(dplyr::group_by(data,
                                        Year,
                                        SpecCode,
                                        LngtClass),
                        "Number" = sum(Number)/numAreas,
                        "LWa" = unique(LWa),
                        "LWb" = unique(LWb),
                        "bodyMass" = unique(bodyMass))
```

`Number` is the average number (of each species and length) caught per
hour of trawling across all seven areas.

Up until here `data` is the same as it was in [MEPS_IBTS_1.html](MEPS_IBTS_1.html).

Now, instead of only including body-mass classes above 4 g (which we did following Blanchard et
al., 2005), we set the cut-off to be 100 g to see if the larger fish are fit
well with the bounded power-law fit only to the larger fish:
```{r}
range(data$LngtClass)
range(data$bodyMass)
sum(data$bodyMass == 0)
sum(data$bodyMass < 100 )
data = dplyr::filter(data, bodyMass >= 100)
range(data$bodyMass)
data
summary(data)
```

Total number of fish in this dataset is
```{r}
sum(data$Number)
```

The unique length classes are:
```{r lengths}
sort(unique(data$LngtClass))
 ```

Need this to stop earlier groups being kept (can mess up later code):
```{r}
data = dplyr::ungroup(data)
```

The equivalent Table 1 (first six and last six rows of the data) is now as
follows, where the last six rows of the original Table 1 are no longer in the
data as they had body masses $<$100 g:
```{r results='asis'}
data_biomass <- dplyr::mutate(data,
                              Biomass = Number * bodyMass)
knitr::kable(rbind(data_biomass[1:6,],
                   data_biomass[(nrow(data_biomass)-5):nrow(data_biomass),
                                     ]),
             digits=c(0, 0, 0, 3, 4, 4, 2, 2))
```

## Analyses of data using the original eight methods

This is simplified from [MEPS_IBTS_2.html](MEPS_IBTS_1.html) -- see that
vignette for full explanations.

See if the number of length classes or species seems to change over time:
```{r, dataSumm}
dataSumm = dplyr::summarise(dplyr::group_by(data, Year),
                            uniqLngtClass = length(unique(LngtClass)),
                            uniqSpec = length(unique(SpecCode)))
par(mfrow=c(2,1)) #7,1))

plot(dataSumm$Year, dataSumm$uniqLngtClass, xlab="Year",
     ylab="No. unique length classes", type="o",
     ylim=c(0, max(dataSumm$uniqLngtClass)))
plot(dataSumm$Year, dataSumm$uniqSpec, xlab="Year",
     ylab="No. unique species", type="o", ylim=c(0, max(dataSumm$uniqSpec)))
```

As for the original full data set, there do not look to be any serious issue with this (no drastic changes in, for
example, species identification through time).

The remaining `eightMethods.count()` and plotting code from
[MEPS_IBTS_2.html](MEPS_IBTS_1.html) is not repeated here since it takes a few
hours to run, and our focus is on repeating the MLEbins method.

## Analyses of IBTS data using the MLEbins method

This section analyses the IBTS data using the MLEbins method, using the
essential calculations from [MEPS_IBTS_MLEbins.html](MEPS_IBTS_MLEbins.html).

### Determining which rows are 0.5 cm bins

`LngtClass` for all species is the minimum value of a 1-cm-width bin, except for
herring (*Clupea harengus*) and sprat (*Sprattus sprattus*) for which lengths
are rounded down to 0.5 cm values (so the bins are 0.5-cm wide). The `SpecCode`
values for these are:

```{r speciesNames}
herringCode = dplyr::filter(specCodeNames, species == "Clupea harengus")$speccode
herringCode
spratCode = dplyr::filter(specCodeNames, species == "Sprattus sprattus")$speccode
spratCode
specCode05 = c(herringCode, spratCode)      # species codes with 0.5cm length bins
```

Verified earlier that only these two species have 0.5 cm values for `LngtClass`.

### Append the max of the bin breaks for each row

So `LngtClass` is the minimum of each length bin. Need to work out the maximum
of each length bin `LengthMax`, and then use the species-specific length-weight
relationships to give the min (`wmin`) and max (`wmax`) of each body-mass bin.
So create `dataBin` table dataframe that has `LengthMax`, `wmin` and `wmax` as
extra columns for each row:

```{r dataBin}
dataBin = dplyr::mutate(data,
                        LngtMax = LngtClass + 1)
aa = which(dataBin$SpecCode %in% specCode05)           # row numbers for herring, sprat
dataBin[aa, "LngtMax"] = dataBin[aa, "LngtMax"] - 0.5  # subtract 0.5 cm to
                                                       # give 0.5-cm wide bins
unique(dataBin$LngtMax - dataBin$LngtClass)            # correctly just has 0.5 and 1
unique( dplyr::filter(dataBin, LngtMax - LngtClass == 0.5)$SpecCode)  # just herring,sprat

dataBin = dplyr::mutate(dataBin, wmax = LWa * LngtMax^LWb)  # calculate max body mass
                                                            # for each bin (min
                                                            # is currently bodyMass)
dataBin = dplyr::rename(dataBin, LngtMin = LngtClass)       # For consistency
dataBin = dplyr::rename(dataBin, wmin = bodyMass)

dataBin = dataBin[ , c("Year", "SpecCode", "LngtMin", "LngtMax",
                       "LWa", "LWb", "wmin", "wmax", "Number")]     # Reorder columns

range(dplyr::mutate(dataBin,
                    wminCheck = LWa * LngtMin^LWb)$wminCheck - dataBin$wmin)
                                              # Verifying that wmin is correct
                                              # (was calculated independently)
length(unique(dataBin$SpecCode))
```

No need to re-plot the body-mass bins for each species, since they won't have
changed from the MEPS paper (there will just be no bins below 100 g, and so some
species will be omitted).

### Likelihood calculations using MLEbins method

Now use the MLEbins method to fit each year of data in turn.

```{r MLEbins}
fullYears = sort(unique(dataBin$Year))
# Do a loop for each year, saving all the results in MLEbins.nSeaFung.new
for(iii in 1:length(fullYears))
  {
    dataBinForLike = dplyr::filter(dataBin,
                                   Year == fullYears[iii])
    dataBinForLike = dplyr::select(dataBinForLike,
                                   SpecCode,
                                   wmin,
                                   wmax,
                                   Number)
    n = sum(dataBinForLike$Number)
    xmin = min(dataBinForLike$wmin)
    xmax = max(dataBinForLike$wmax)

    MLEbins.nSeaFung.oneyear.new  = calcLike(negLL.fn = negLL.PLB.bins.species,
                                             p = -1.9,
                                             suppress.warnings = TRUE,
                                             dataBinForLike = dataBinForLike,
                                             n = n,
                                             xmin = xmin,
                                             xmax = xmax)

    if(iii == 1)
    {
      MLEbins.nSeaFung.new = data.frame(Year = fullYears[iii],
                                        xmin=xmin,
                                        xmax=xmax,
                                        n=n,
                                        b=MLEbins.nSeaFung.oneyear.new$MLE,
                                        confMin=MLEbins.nSeaFung.oneyear.new$conf[1],
                                        confMax=MLEbins.nSeaFung.oneyear.new$conf[2])
    } else {
      MLEbins.nSeaFung.new = rbind(MLEbins.nSeaFung.new,
                                   c(fullYears[iii],
                                     xmin,
                                     xmax,
                                     n,
                                     MLEbins.nSeaFung.oneyear.new$MLE,
                                     MLEbins.nSeaFung.oneyear.new$conf[1],
                                     MLEbins.nSeaFung.oneyear.new$conf[2]))
   }
}

# Need the standard error for weighted linear regression,
#  see eightMethods.count() for details:
MLEbins.nSeaFung.new = dplyr::tbl_df(MLEbins.nSeaFung.new)
MLEbins.nSeaFung.new = dplyr::mutate(MLEbins.nSeaFung.new,
                                     stdErr = (abs(confMin-b) +
                                               abs(confMax-b))/(2*1.96) )
MLEbins.nSeaFung.new
```

Now to plot the results and obtain the regression fit:
```{r timeseries, fig.width=7.5, fig.height=6}
postscript("../IBTS-min-100/trends100.eps",
           height = 6, width = 7.5, horizontal = FALSE, paper = "special")
res = timeSerPlot(MLEbins.nSeaFung.new,
                  legName = "(a) MLEbins",
                  yLim = c(-3.4, -2.1),
                  xLab = "Year",
                  method = "",
                  legPos = "bottomleft",
                  weightReg = TRUE,
                  xTicksSmallInc = 1,
                  yTicksSmallInc = 0.05)
dev.off()
```

The statistics for the regression fit (like those in Table S.1) are:
```{r}
trendResultsMLEbinsNew = dplyr::tbl_df(res)
knitr::kable(dplyr::select(trendResultsMLEbinsNew, Method, Low, Trend, High, p, Rsquared),
             digits=c(NA, 4, 4, 4, 2, 2))
```

For an equivalent to Table S.2 (results for each year for the MLEbins method), need the constant
*C* for each year, so calculate it here:
```{r}
MLEbins.res = MLEbins.nSeaFung.new
MLEbins.res = dplyr::mutate(MLEbins.res,
                            C = (b != -1 ) * (b+1) / ( xmax^(b+1) - xmin^(b+1) ) +
                                (b == -1) * 1 / ( log(xmax) - log(xmin) )
                           )
MLEbins.res = dplyr::select(MLEbins.res, -stdErr)
knitr::kable(dplyr::select(MLEbins.res, Year, xmin, xmax, n, confMin, b,
                           confMax, C),
             digits=c(0, rep(2, 7)))
```

## Recommended plotting approach from the MLEbins method

Recommended plotting approach of results for each year, as in
[MEPS_IBTS_recommend.html](MEPS_IBTS_recommend.html).

First just get what's needed for the calculations for the recommended plot:
TODO - replace with functionalised code if that gets done:
```{r recommended}
dataRecommend.isd = dplyr::select(dataBin,
                                  Year,
                                  wmin,
                                  wmax,
                                  Number)

data.year.list = list()                # to save results for each year
diff.ivec = vector()                   # to save i that have any cumSum !=
                                       # verify TODO
fullYears = sort(unique(dataBin$Year))
for(i in 1:length(fullYears))
  {
    data.year = dplyr::filter(dataRecommend.isd,
                              Year == fullYears[i])

    data.year = dplyr::arrange(data.year,
                               desc(wmin))
    sumNumber = sum(data.year$Number)

    # Have to do not with dplyr:
    wmin.vec = data.year$wmin
    wmax.vec = data.year$wmax
    num.vec  = data.year$Number

    countGTEwmin = rep(NA, length(num.vec)) # to do a manual count
    lowCount = countGTEwmin
    highCount = countGTEwmin

    for(iii in 1:length(countGTEwmin))
    {
      countGTEwmin[iii]    = sum( (wmin.vec >= wmin.vec[iii]) * num.vec)
      lowCount[iii]  = sum( (wmin.vec >= wmax.vec[iii]) * num.vec)
      highCount[iii] = sum( (wmax.vec >  wmin.vec[iii]) * num.vec)
    }
    data.year = cbind(data.year,
                      "countGTEwmin" = countGTEwmin,
                      "lowCount" = lowCount,
                      "highCount" = highCount)
    data.year = dplyr::tbl_df(data.year)

    data.year.list[[i]] = data.year
}

```

Here is the code to give an animation for the equivalent Figures 7 and S.5-S.34
for the IBTS data (now with minimum body size set to 100 g). For each year
(given in top-right corner) the plot shows the individual size distribution and
MLEbins fit (red solid curve) with 95\% confidence intervals (red dashed curves, may be hard to see).
For each bin, the horizontal green line shows the range of body sizes, with value on the y-axis
corresponding to the total number of individuals in bins whose minima are $\geq$
the bin's minimum.  For each bin, the vertical span of the grey rectangle shows
the possible range of the number of individuals with body mass $\geq$ the body
mass of individuals in that bin (horizontal span is the same as for the green
lines). The text in (a) gives the year, the MLE for the size-spectrum exponent
$b$, and the sample size $n$.

```{r plotparams}
xlim.global = c(min(dataRecommend.isd$wmin),
                max(dataRecommend.isd$wmax))
```

Here is the code to build the movie, but it is commented out since it causes Travis
to fail -- Travis is the continuous integration service that automatically
checks the packages builds every time a change is committed to GitHub, giving the
little green symbol `passing` icon on the main page. The trick to showing the
movie is to run the code uncommented (you need to install the `gifski` package), right-click on the animation in the
html viewer and save it. I've done that and so am leaving this code commented,
and will just refer to the saved animation file.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
# ```
# {r, animation.hook = 'gifski', interval = 1.5, fig.width = 5.36, fig.height = 8}
## fig.width is 0.67 * fig.height (which is 8)
#
#for(i in 1:length(fullYears))
#  {
#  ISD_bin_plot(data.year = data.year.list[[i]],
#              b.MLE = dplyr::filter(MLEbins.res, Year == fullYears[i])$b,
#              b.confMin = dplyr::filter(MLEbins.res, Year ==
#                                                   fullYears[i])$confMin,
#              b.confMax = dplyr::filter(MLEbins.res, Year ==
#                                                   fullYears[i])$confMax,
#              year = fullYears[i],
#              xlim = xlim.global,
#              xmin = dplyr::filter(MLEbins.res, Year ==
#                                                   fullYears[i])$xmin,
#              xmax = dplyr::filter(MLEbins.res, Year ==
#                                                fullYears[i])$xmax,
#             yBig.inc = 500,
#              ySmall.inc = 100)
# }
# ```
```

The resulting animation is

![IBTS_100_movie.gif](IBTS_100_movie.gif).

To save each year as it's own figure do this (not it running here; you have to
make the `IBTS-min-100` directory first):
```{r, eval=FALSE}
for(i in 1:length(fullYears))
  {
  postscript(paste0("../IBTS-min-100/IBTS-ISD", fullYears[i], ".eps"),
           height = 8, width = 5.36,
