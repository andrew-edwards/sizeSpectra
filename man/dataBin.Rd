\title{The \code{IBTS_data} amended with explicit length and body mass ranges for each
bin for using the MLEbins method}
\format{
Dataframe where each of 42,298 rows is a unique combination of \code{Year},
\code{SpecCode} and \code{LngtMin}. Columns are:
\itemize{
\item Year: Year of survey
\item SpecCode: Species code
\item LngtMin: The minimum value (cm) of each length bin, same as
\code{LngtClass} in \code{IBTS_data}.
\item LngtMax: The maximum value (cm) of each length bin, taking into
account that all bin widths are 1 cm except for Atlantic Herring and European
Sprat that are 0.5 cm.
\item LWa: Length-weight coefficient \eqn{\alpha} from Fung et al. (2012) for that
species, as per our MEPS equation (1).
\item LWb: Length-weight coefficient \eqn{\beta} from Fung et al. (2012) for that
species, as per our MEPS equation (1).
\item wmin: The minimum value (g) of each body-mass bin, based on the
species-specific length-weight coefficients and \code{LngtMin}.
\item wmax: The maximum value (g) of each body-mass bin, based on the
species-specific length-weight coefficients and \code{LngtMax}.
\item Number: Number of individuals per hour of trawling observed for that
combination of \code{Year}, \code{SpecCode} and \code{LngtMin}.
