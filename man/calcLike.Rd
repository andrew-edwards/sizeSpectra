interval}
\usage{
calcLike(
  negLL.fn,
  p,
  vecDiff = 0.5,
  vecInc = 0.001,
  suppress.warnings = FALSE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{negLL.fn}{negative log-likelihood function that take arguments
(parameters and data) in ... and returns a negative
log-likelihood value.}

\item{p}{starting point to calculate the maximum likelihood estimate}

\item{vecDiff}{the range over which to test the negative log-likelihood
to construct the confidence interval. Default is 0.5 and a symmetric
range is tested for fitting size spectra, since for movement data
sets in Table 2 of Edwards (2011; 92(6):1247-1257) the intervals were
symmetric, so symmetric seems a good start.}

\item{vecInc}{increments to try, the accuracy of the resulting bounds
will depend on this. Note that a resulting interval of, say,
(-2.123, -1.987) means that that interval is contained within the
true 95\\% interval, which is itself contained within (-2.124, -1.986).
The true bounds lie between the stated lower bounds and between
the stated upper bounds. So reduce \code{vecInc} if further accuracy is needed.}

\item{suppress.warnings}{If TRUE then suppress warnings from the \code{nlm()}
calculations; for the \code{MEPS_IBTS_MLEbins} vignette these occur a lot, and
are always:
\verb{Warning in nlm(f = negLL.fn, p = p, ...) : NA/Inf replaced by maximum positive value}. The same warning often happens in other
situations also. It is due to the likelihood function blowing up,
presumably when searching some very very very unlikely region of paramater space.}

\item{...}{further arguments (including parameters and data) to \code{negLL.fn()}}
}
\value{
\preformatted{  list containing:
}
\itemize{
\item MLE: the maximum likelihood estimate
\item conf: the 95\\% confidence interval of the MLE
}
}
\description{
Calculate maximum likelihood estimate of a parameter and its 95\\% confidence
interval using the profile log-likelihood method, for a given
negative log-likelihood function and its arguments (other parameters and data).
Will likely give warnings that can safely be ignored (see
\code{suppress.warnings} description below).
